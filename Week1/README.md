# Reading Material Browsers Week 1

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 1:

1. [What is a web browser?](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/browser)
   - How a browser works
   - Different browsers work differently
1. [Refresher on DOM & DOM manipulation](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/explore/tree/main/Week4)
1. [Presenting](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module)

## Week goals
All of the detailed information about every concept is in your study book. The following goal explanation will link you to the correct place to get studying. Read through the goal description once to get an idea of what you will be learning, then go through the different links (either from the agenda or this goal list).

This week we will do a little refresher of things you learned in the explore module and start working on our soft skills. Let's first take a closer look at browsers and how they work over [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/browser).

In the project of next week you will need to manipulate the DOM a lot so refresh your knowledge of those topics that were covered in the explore module over [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/explore/tree/main/Week4).

We will also work on our soft skills by reading up on the principles of presenting in the [presentation module](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module/).
