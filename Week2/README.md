# Reading Material Browser Week 2

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 2:

1. [Agile development](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/software-development/agile)
2. [Revisit Naming conventions](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/programming/naming-conventions)
3. [DRY](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/dont-repeat-yourself)
4. [Incremental Coding](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/incremental-coding)
5. [Group Project time!](../PROJECT.md)


## Week(s) goals
In the next two weeks you will be working on a group project with guidance from a mentor! This will be your first experience of working on code together, which is what you will be doing daily at your job. As a group, you will build a quiz app, combining everything you have learned so far (HTML/CSS/JS) in a practical example. Once completed, you will have an individual 'tech interview' about the application you have built. These kinds of interviews are very similar to what you will encounter when you start looking for a job, so it is an occasion to already start practicing. Luckily, you are also working on the presentation module this week, which will help you with your tech interview skills!

Learn more about the project [here](../PROJECT.md). The project starts on Sunday. To best prepare for that, we would like you to spend the upcoming days looking into some information about working together and how software development teams do that. Your study book has a nice section on agile [here](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/software-development/agile). This is based on bigger teams and projects, but it should give you an indication of how software developers work. Your mentors may use some of these terms when guiding you through the project.

This will also be the first time you will work with bigger code bases and less defined problems. It is therefore a good idea to revisit some of the material that was mentioned in your JavaScript module on coding practices. Refresh your memory on the topic of [Naming conventions](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/programming/naming-conventions) and have a look at the [DRY principle](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/dont-repeat-yourself). We would also like to introduce you to a technique that programmers use in order to solve problems in such a way not to get lost: Incremental Coding. Read all about it [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/programming/incremental-coding) and get into the habit of using this technique whenever you are solving a tough problem, like the ones you will face in the project. It will save you a lot of headaches...
