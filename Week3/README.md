# Reading Material Browsers Week 3

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 3:

1. [Group Project!](../PROJECT.md)
  - Sunday: Group demonstrations and feedback on the projects
  - Mock interview (Test)
2. [Final individual presentation](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module/blob/main/assignment2.md)

## Week goals
For most of this week you are going to be finishing up your project, there are no new reading materials! Have a look at the project explanation [here](../PROJECT.md) to see what is expected.

You will also get a message from one of the HYF core members to plan a time for your final presentation for the presentation module. See [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module/blob/main/assignment2.md) what is expected then.

> Note: While working with the DOM we need to also keep thinking about how we can test what we build. Testing using the DOM gets a lot more complicated as we need to somehow interact with the browser during our tests which is not easy. There are ways to do it, but later on in the curriculum we will be going into frontend frameworks that will actually take a lot of the difficulty away. This means for now that we will not be testing our code (if you are interested, your assignment is being tested using JSDOM, you can have a look at those tests).
